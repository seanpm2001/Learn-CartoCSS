I don't know how to make strings in CartoCSS, so comments will do for now

/* Project language file 1
For: seanpm2001/Learn-CartoCSS
About:
I decided to make CartoCSS the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-CartoCSS) as CartoCSS is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the CartoCSS programming language. It only makes sense to CartoCSS the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
